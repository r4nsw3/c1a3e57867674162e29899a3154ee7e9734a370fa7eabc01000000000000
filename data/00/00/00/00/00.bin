  |   In Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, one player is trapped in a       |
  |   room with a ticking time bomb they must defuse. The other players     |
  |   are the "Experts" who must give the instructions to defuse the bomb   |
  |   by deciphering the information found in the Bomb Defusal Manual.      |
  |   But there's a catch: the Experts can't see the bomb, so everyone      |
  |   will need to talk it out - fast!                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Rounds are fast-paced, tense, occasionally silly, and almost always   |
  |   loud.                                                                 |

  |   Puzzle solving and communication skills - and maybe a few             |
  |   friendships - will be put to the test as players race to defuse       |
  |   bombs while communicating quickly, clearly, and effectively.          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Bomb Defusal Manual is freely available at                        |
  |   http://www.bombmanual.com and can be printed or viewed on a tablet    |
  |   or any other web-enabled device.                                      |

  |     skills... and friendships                                           |

  |   * A different bomb every time - Procedurally generated puzzles keep   |
